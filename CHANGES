ledgertools-dev :: ???
======================

New features
------------

- ``lt-transact`` is now more configurable.  The global config
  ``transact-default-account`` specifies the default account.
  ``transact-default-src`` and ``transact-default-dst`` specify the
  default source and destination accounts and can be set on a
  per-account basis.
- ``lt-transact`` now reads rule files and processes transactions
  against rulesets.
- ``lt-transact`` now asks if the user would like to enter another
  transaction before exiting.
- ``lt-transact`` now prints the account it is working with before
  beginning transaction entry.

Bug fixes
---------

- Take the absolute value of the CSV "Debit" field in order to work
  if these values happen to be negative.
- Better config file handling (do not try to read config file during
  import of ``ltlib.config``.
